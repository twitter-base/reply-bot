## Twitter Reply Bot
```
npm install twitter-reply-bot
yarn reply-bot
```

there's also a `twitter-reply-bot` bin and eventually you can source it and i'll separate _my_ bot from it.

`.env` / `.env.twitter` , injected into your environment may work :

```
TEXT=
USER=
ACCESS_TOKEN=
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=
IN_REPLY_TO_STATUS_ID_STR=
STATUS=
MEDIA_FILE=
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN=
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=
TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY=
TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET=
TWITTER_WEBHOOK_ENV=
MODULE_SCREEN_NAME=
BOT_NAME=
SIGNATURE=
HEADLESS=
NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN=
RUNNER_SECONDS=
```
some of these may not be needed,
rules for how this works can be found in the source code,
ngrok auth token requires registration at https://ngrok.com/
